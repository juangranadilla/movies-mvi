# movies-mvi

This is a sample [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) application to show what I've learned about MVI (Model View Intent) architecture pattern, applied in a clean architecture project, using [the new integration between Coroutines and Architecture Components](https://medium.com/corouteam/exploring-kotlin-coroutines-and-lifecycle-architectural-components-integration-on-android-c63bb8a9156f). 

## Dependencies

The application uses the following libraries:

* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) for concurrency
* [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) for dependency injection
* [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) (Architecture component)
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for networking
* [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) for logging
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) for loading images

## Architecture

I'm using [Clean Architecture](https://proandroiddev.com/clean-architecture-data-flow-dependency-rule-615ffdd79e29), with [Model View Intent](https://www.raywenderlich.com/817602-mvi-architecture-for-android-tutorial-getting-started) as architecture pattern. To do so, I've structured the application in different modules like the following:
* **App module:** is part of the presentation layer. It contains the application class, activities, and fragments, and set up the Koin (dependency injection) modules, so it depends on all modules.
* **Presentation module:** contains ViewModels and view state models. It depends on the domain module.
* **Domain module:** contains the use cases, actions, results, entities and repository interfaces. It has no dependency. It's the most inner part of "the onion"
* **Data module:** contains repository implementations with different data sources (local, remote, cache). In this case, I only have a remote source and a simple local cache.

## TMDB API

The app uses the https://www.themoviedb.org/ API, so you need to use your own API key. Just add your API key in the *local.properties* file like the following:

```
tmdb_api_key="your_api_key"
```

## Kotlin DSL
I've also tried using [Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) instead of Groovy in Gradle files. And also used the [Gradle Versions Plugin](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin) to check for available libraries updates, as Kotlin DSL Gradle files won't notify about that.
