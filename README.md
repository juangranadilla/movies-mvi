This is a sample [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) application to show what I've learn about MVI (Model View Intent) architecture pattern, applied in a clean architecture project, using [the new integration between Coroutines and Architecture Components](https://medium.com/corouteam/exploring-kotlin-coroutines-and-lifecycle-architectural-components-integration-on-android-c63bb8a9156f)

## Dependencies

The application uses the following libraries:

* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) for concurrency
* [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) for dependency injection
* [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) (Architecture component)
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for networking
* [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) for logging
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) for loading images

## TMDB API

The app uses the https://www.themoviedb.org/ API, so you need to use your own API key. Just add your API key in the *local.properties* file like the following:

```
tmdb_api_key="your_api_key"
```
